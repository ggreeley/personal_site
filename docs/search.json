At Stony Brook, I’ve earned an M.A. in Psychology and the Advanced Certificate in Quantitative Methods, en route to the Ph.D (expected 2024). For more details on my academic training and background, see my full LINK ACADEMIC CV or my LINK RESUME.\n Skills\nGeneral: Experimental design, project management, public speaking, scientific/technical writing, supervision/mentoring, teaching.\nLanguages & Platforms: Proficient with R and the fundamentals of Git/Github. Some experience with Python, LaTeX, SAS, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.\nStatistics & Modeling: Correlation, linear regression/ANOVA (OLS), generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect OLS and GLMs, meta-analysis, multivariate methods (e.g., EFA/CFA), some experience with Bayesian methods.\n Hobbies\nWhen not doing or thinking about research, I’m probably watching a movie or series, reading non-fiction, or deciding what food to order.\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\nI’m interested in a number of topics, namely \\(-\\)\nSocial & Collective Memory\nHow does collaboration in face-to-face and online environments influence memory performance?\nHow does working in a group, or being a member of a group, influence the emergence of collective memory?\nHow does remembering information in a social context (e.g., in a group) influence the subsequent learning of new information?\nHow do different social network features (structure/dynamics) influence the development and maintenance of collective memory?\n\nQuantifying Collective Memory\nWhat does it mean for an event/story/etc. to be collectively remembered?\nCan we use metrics from research on individual memory (e.g., clustering, temporal contiguity) to quantify the “structure” of collective memory?\nHow does collective memory change across time?\n\nCollective Memory \\(\\leftarrow\\) ? \\(\\rightarrow\\) Collective Belief/Decisions/Behavior\nHow does collective memory influence other collective phenomena, such as collective beliefs and decisions?\nWhat role does collective memory play in the accumulation of culture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact & Updates\nEmail: garrett.greeley@gmail.com or garrett.greeley@stonybrook.edu\nSite last updated on 15 April, 2022\n\n\n\n",
