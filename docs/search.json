      "contents": "\nBrief Background\n Education \\(-\\)\nBefore coming to Stony Brook, I earned my B.A. in Psychology at Winona State University in Minnesota and was a summer research intern in the Cognition and Development Lab at Yale University. At Stony Brook, I’ve earned an M.A. in Psychology and the Advanced Certificate in Quantitative Methods, en route to the Ph.D. For more details on my academic training and background, see my full ACADEMIC CV or my RESUME.\n Skills \\(-\\)\nGeneral: Experimental design, project management, public speaking, scientific/technical writing, supervision/mentoring, teaching.\nLanguages: Proficient with R and the fundamentals of Git/Github. Some experience with Python, LaTeX, SAS, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.\nStatistics/Modeling: Correlation, linear regression/ANOVA (OLS), generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect OLS and GLMs, meta-analysis, multivariate methods (e.g., EFA/CFA), some Bayesian methods.\n Hobbies \\(-\\)\nWhen not doing or thinking about research, I’m probably watching a movie/series, reading non-fiction, or deciding what food to order.\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\nI’m interested in a number of topics, namely \\(-\\)\nSocial & Collective Memory\nHow does collaboration in face-to-face and online environments influence memory performance?\nHow does working in a group, or being a member of a group, influence the emergence of collective memory?\nHow does remembering information in a social context (e.g., in a group) influence the subsequent learning of new information?\nHow do different social network features (structure/dynamics) influence the development and maintenance of collective memory?\n\nQuantifying Collective Memory\nWhat does it mean for an event/story/etc. to be collectively remembered?\nCan we use metrics from research on individual memory (e.g., clustering, temporal contiguity) to quantify the “structure” of collective memory?\nHow does collective memory change across time?\n\nCollective Memory \\(\\leftarrow\\) ? \\(\\rightarrow\\) Collective Belief/Decisions/Behavior\nHow does collective memory influence other collective phenomena, such as collective beliefs and decisions?\nWhat role does collective memory play in the accumulation of culture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdates\nSite last updated on 07 January, 2022\n\n\n\n",
