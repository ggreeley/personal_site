At Stony Brook, I’ve earned an M.A. in Psychology and the Advanced Certificate in Quantitative Methods, en route to the Ph.D. (expected 2024). For more details on my academic training and background, see my full CV.\n Skills\nGeneral: Experimental design, project management, public speaking, scientific/technical writing, supervision/mentoring, teaching.\nLanguages & Platforms: Proficient with R and the fundamentals of Git/Github. Some experience with Python, LaTeX, SAS, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.\nStatistics & Modeling: Correlation, linear regression/ANOVA (OLS), generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect OLS and GLMs, meta-analysis, multivariate methods (e.g., EFA/CFA), some experience with Bayesian methods.\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\nI’m interested in a number of topics, namely \\(-\\)\nCollective Memory & Retrieval Dynamics\nHow does working in a group, or being a member of a group, influence the emergence of collective memory?\nHow does collaborative recall synchronize not only what, but how individuals retrieve material?\nHow does collective memory change across time?\n\nSocial Remembering\nHow does collaboration in face-to-face and online environments influence memory performance?\nHow does remembering information in a social context (e.g., in a group) influence the subsequent learning of new information?\n\nApplying Collective/Social Memory\nHow can findings in the lab relating to collective/social memory be leveraged in educational contexts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact & Updates\nEmail: garrett.greeley@gmail.com or garrett.greeley@stonybrook.edu\n\n\n\n",
