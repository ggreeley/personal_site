# Brief Background

<font size="4"> **Education**</font>

Before coming to Stony Brook, I earned my B.A. in Psychology at Winona State University in Minnesota and was a summer research intern in the Cognition and Development Lab at Yale University. At Stony Brook, I've earned an M.A. in Psychology and the Advanced Certificate in Quantitative Methods, en route to the Ph.D. (expected 2024). For more details on my academic training and background, see my full [CV](https://ggreeley.github.io/personal_site/pdfs/2022-10-greeley-cv.pdf).

<font size="4"> **Skills**</font>

*General*: Experimental design, project management, public speaking, scientific/technical writing, supervision/mentoring, teaching. 

*Languages & Platforms*: Proficient with R and the fundamentals of Git/Github. Some experience with Python, LaTeX, SAS, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

*Statistics & Modeling*: Correlation, linear regression/ANOVA (OLS), generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect OLS and GLMs, meta-analysis, multivariate methods (e.g., EFA/CFA), some experience with Bayesian methods.

# Research Interests

I'm interested in a number of topics, namely $-$

- **Collective Memory & Retrieval Dynamics**
  - How does working in a group, or being a member of a group, influence the emergence of *collective memory*?
  - How does collaborative recall synchronize not only what, but *how individuals retrieve* material?
  - How does collective memory *change across time*?

- **Social Remembering**
  - How does collaboration in face-to-face and online environments influence *memory performance*?
  - How does remembering information in a social context (e.g., in a group) influence the *subsequent learning of new information*?
  
- **Applying Collective/Social Memory**
  - How can findings in the lab relating to collective/social memory be leveraged in *educational contexts*?
